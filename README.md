Caloric Intake Calculator
- The caloric intake calculator helps users determine their daily caloric intake based on factors such as weight, height, age, gender, and activity level.

- Navigate to the "Calculate Caloric Intake" page.
- Fill in the required fields, including weight, height, age, gender, and activity level.
- Click the "Calculate Caloric Intake" button to get your total caloric intake.

Macronutrient Calculator
- The macronutrient calculator provides users with recommended macronutrient distribution based on their daily caloric intake.

- Navigate to the "Calculate Macros" page.
- Enter your daily caloric intake.
- Click the "Calculate Macronutrients" button to get recommended protein, fats, and carbohydrate values.

Food Information
The Food Information tool in CalCalc utilizes the USDA FoodData Central API to provide users with detailed nutritional information for a specific food item.

- Navigate to the "Food Information" page.
- Enter the name of the food item in the search bar.
- Click the "Search" button to retrieve nutritional information.
About the API
- The Food Information tool fetches data from the USDA FoodData Central API. This API offers a comprehensive database of food information, including details on various nutrients present
in different food items. The API key, required for accessing the USDA API, is securely hidden.

Implementation Details
- The getFoodInformation() function is responsible for making requests to the API, processing the received data, and displaying relevant nutritional information on the webpage. It handles
cases where information is found, not found, or if an error occurs during the data retrieval process.
